Update:
We used our big brain to math the text ontot he button correctly (YESS!!)
However, we are struggling to get full screen to work, but work can still be done on the smaller resolution
so we can worry about it later

For clarity: master_surface is implemented and passde through each screen class, but not
             used for full screen logic yet 21:18 06/01/2025

Current goals:
- adjust button text to dynamically fit dimensions of button rectangle
- NEVERMINDDD MAKE THE WINDOW SIZE FIXED!!!




some ernest advice for screen resolution dynamics whatever

"Your screen/window will probs be huge. You create a surface, blit everything to that one surface. Then scale the surface and blit that to the screen"

"Not talking about your display surface
That you make using pygame.display.set_mode
A separate surface
Sorry, it's been a while since I used pygame, I forgot the window itself is a surface too lol"

- me
"So
I ahve another surface, that isnt the display surface
blit everything onto there
thenn scale the surface holding everything, then blit it to the actual display surface?"
