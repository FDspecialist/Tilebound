IMPORTANT: REMEMBER TO CHANGE OR REMOVE TEMP ICON
Update:
fixed button inputs for main menu, DO NOT put event logic inside main.py, place inside screens instead


Current issues:
Side effect from making button work, console not spits out current event and position
on every tick, i cant find where it is being printed :c

Dynamic screen switching
    Button input detected, will attempt to add screen switch logic

Full screen:
    now default


For clarity: master_surface is implemented and passed through each screen class, but not
             used for full screen logic yet 21:18 06/01/2025
