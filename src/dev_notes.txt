"Your screen/window will probs be huge. You create a surface, blit everything to that one surface. Then scale the surface and blit that to the screen"

"Not talking about your display surface
That you make using pygame.display.set_mode
A separate surface
Sorry, it's been a while since I used pygame, I forgot the window itself is a surface too lol"

- me
"So
I ahve another surface, that isnt the display surface
blit everything onto there
thenn scale the surface holding everything, then blit it to the actual display surface?"
