Update:
Current issues:
Gordon is an absolute genius, solved my code without me ahving to show it
however won't go bakc to normal screen but meh I can work with this instead no big deal, if i mathed it right
it must be scalable

trying to customise game screen, however any changes made currently dont appear
game screen only displays a white canvas



Dynamic screen switching
    Still working on button input, pygame will run
    however shows no response to any input in the console

Full screen:
    screen_manager values and screens keys values changed and matched
    'example_screen' ---> 0 (index)






Fullscreen: not implemented

For clarity: master_surface is implemented and passed through each screen class, but not
             used for full screen logic yet 21:18 06/01/2025




Current goals:
Dynamic screen switching
    Button input

Add backgrounds
    See if assets.py still loads files correctly



Important milestones:
    File management
    Player and Computer class management
    2D Array (visuals especially)
    Unit generation ---> see C# prototype
    Computer Pathfinding
    Computer behaviour
    Tile and Unit relationship












some ernest advice for screen resolution dynamics whatever

"Your screen/window will probs be huge. You create a surface, blit everything to that one surface. Then scale the surface and blit that to the screen"

"Not talking about your display surface
That you make using pygame.display.set_mode
A separate surface
Sorry, it's been a while since I used pygame, I forgot the window itself is a surface too lol"

- me
"So
I ahve another surface, that isnt the display surface
blit everything onto there
thenn scale the surface holding everything, then blit it to the actual display surface?"
